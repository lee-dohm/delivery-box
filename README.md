# Delivery Box

Plans to build a box for receiving deliveries that disinfects what was delivered using UV-C light.

## Disinfection

* Light at wavelengths shorter than 290nm are generally found to be germicidal
* UV-C is the band from 200-280nm
* Most bacteria and viruses can be killed by a dose of 8,000 μW·s/cm² of UV-C light
